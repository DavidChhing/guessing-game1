# Guessing Game 1
###### Last updated on 02/08/2018

## Brief Description
The guessing game consists of 6 questions about myself. It will prompt the user with yes/no, or multiple choices questions. After the user has had a chance to take a guess for each question, a pop up message will alert the user how many questions they got correct. Then, it will display the answers on the webpage. My webpage also shares some cool facts about myself, and my bio.
