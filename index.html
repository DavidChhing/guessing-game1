    <h2> My Bio </h2>
    <p>
        I was originally born in Portland, however I've lived in Beaverton/Hillsboro all my life. I've had a handfull of jobs in
        my life, with my latest one working at a large bank. I've always love technology and coding is something that's always
        interested me. I love the idea of typing a piece of code in the computer and watch it do my bidding. I want to further
        my education and learn as much as I can so I can one day share my knowledge of coding onto another eager learner.
